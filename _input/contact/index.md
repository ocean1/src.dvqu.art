The best way to contact me is via [e-mail](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01XgUP9L-ca6skQRrxCkEU4Q==&c=EpW6X9EYPxYp6WQkIV909YzOEPC9H4eDR1BkyLhJfKY=): I usually
answer within 1 day. If that doesn't happen, feel free to ping me via instant
messaging (on Google Hangouts, Skype or Facebook Messenger), Slack or IRC
(mainly on [Freenode](http://freenode.net)), where I go by “phretor”.

If you need to communicate with my privately, use my [GPG public
key](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x96934CDEC0BBEBCF). Its fingerprint is `C42B 0CC7 6191 5B69 2C68 E88F 9693 4CDE C0BB EBCF`. If you prefer [modern alternatives](https://blog.filippo.io/giving-up-on-long-term-pgp/), yes, I use Signal (and you should, too), and Twitter.
