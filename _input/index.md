## About me
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [System Security group](http://www.s3.eurecom.fr) at [Eurecom](http://www.eurecom.fr) under the supervision of [Davide Balzarotti](http://s3.eurecom.fr/~balzarot/). I received my PhD from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) where I worked in the [NECSTLab] under the supervision of [Stefano Zanero](http://home.deib.polimi.it/zanero/) and [Federico Maggi](https://maggi.cc/).
I received my *Laurea Magistrale* in Software and Digital Systems, and *Laurea* from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/).

As a Marie-Sk≈Çodowska Curie alumni, I've been an exchange student at UC Santa Barbara' [SecLab](https://seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/), working under the supervision of [Giovanni Vigna](https://cs.ucsb.edu/~vigna/) and [Christopher Kruegel](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~chris/). At the end of my PhD I also had a chance to work as an engineering intern in Qualcomm' Product Security group under the supervision of [Pouyan Sepehrdad](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I-kR9XsAAAAJ).

I love teaching: I worked as *TA* in basic programming, and computer security courses, and as a freelance consultant I teached malware analysis, and mobile and windows reverse engineering for the [Consorzio Interuniversitario Nazionale per l'Informatica](https://www.consorzio-cini.it), and national, and international clients of Italian security firms [Secure Network](https://www.securenetwork.it), and [Shorr Kan](http://www.shorr-kan.com/). Check out my condensed [CV](/s/cv.pdf).

### Research interests

I love Reverse Engineering in <a href="/projects/">all of its forms</a>. I worked on (android) malware analysis as *Research Assistant* in Politecnico di Milano, working on the <a href="https://andrototal.org">Andrototal</a> project, and more in general on malware analysis as a freelance consultant. I am currently working on the <a href="projects/#crave">CrAVe</a> project to develop a deeper understanding of anti-malware solutions, and how they are impacted by evasive malware.
During my PhD I focused instead on <a href="https://robosec.org">Industrial systems</a> and more in general on the inherent challenges posed IoT and embedded systems at large.

My current research interest lies at the intersection of these two topics, where we'll probably see more and more attacks being carried on by *implants* on embedded systems (i.e., Mirai).
