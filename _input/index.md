I am a Senior Threat Researcher with [Trend Micro’s Forward-Looking Threat
Research (FTR)
team](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/), an
elite team of researchers whose mission is to fighting against cyber criminals
and scouting the future of emerging technologies, striving to predict and
prevent emerging security risks and threats.

My research interests, mainly developed during my MSc and PhD, revolve around
various topics under the “cyber security” and “cyber crime” umbrella terms,
including threat analysis, malware analysis, mobile security, financial fraud
analysis and detection, web- and social-network security and data analysis.

Before joining Trend Micro, I was an Assistant Professor at
[Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria
(DEIB)](http://www.deib.polimi.it), [Politecnico di Milano](http://polimi.it)
in Italy, where I co-directed the system-security group at the [NECST
Laboratory](http://necst.it).

In my career, I collaborate(d) with several research groups (e.g., UCSB, FORTH,
NEU, Stony Brook, KU Leven, and RHUL), and I have given several lectures and
[talks](/talks) as an invited speaker at international venues and research
schools. I also serve in the review or organizing committees of well-known
conferences.
