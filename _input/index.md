## About me
I am a Senior Threat Researcher with [Trend Micro’s Forward-Looking Threat
Research (FTR)
team](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/), an
elite team of researchers whose mission is to fighting against cyber criminals
and scouting the future of emerging technologies, striving to predict and
prevent emerging security risks and threats.

My research interests, mainly rooted in MSc and PhD, revolve around various
topics under the “cyber security” and “cyber crime” umbrella terms, including
threat analysis, malware analysis, mobile security, financial fraud analysis
and detection, web- and social-network security and data analysis. I've
presented my research at various international venues including academic
conferences and industry conferences (such as Black Hat), as well as closed-door
events.

I come from the academic world: I was an Assistant Professor at
[Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria
(DEIB)](http://www.deib.polimi.it), [Politecnico di Milano](http://polimi.it)
in Italy, where I co-directed the system-security group at the [NECST
Laboratory](http://necst.it).

In my career, I collaborate(d) with several research groups (e.g., UCSB, FORTH,
NEU, Stony Brook, KU Leven, and RHUL), and I have given several lectures and
[talks](/talks) as an invjted speaker at international venues and research
schools. I also serve in the review or organizing committees of well-known
conferences.

A [longer version of my bio](/about) is available, and more details can be
found in my [CV](/cv) at my [LinkedIn profile
page](https://linkedin.com/in/phretor).
