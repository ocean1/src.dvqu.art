This is probably the 5th time I try to start a blog. For various reasons
(mainly, lack of time), I've always failed. So I said to myself, let's try
something in between: not a blog-blog, but a blog-diary, where I can annotate
stuff I want to highlight to the visitors, as well as longer posts when I feel
like.

Let's see how it goes this time.
