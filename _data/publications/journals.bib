  abstract      = {In modern factories, ``controlled'' manufacturing systems,
                  such as industrial robots, CNC machines, or 3D printers, are
                  often connected in a control network, together with a
                  plethora of heterogeneous control devices. Despite the
                  obvious advantages in terms of production and ease of
                  maintenance, this trend raises non-trivial cybersecurity
                  concerns. Often, the devices employed are not designed for an
                  interconnected world, but cannot be promptly replaced: In
                  fact, they have essentially become legacy systems, embodying
                  design patterns where components and networks are accounted
                  as trusted elements. In this paper, we take a holistic view
                  of the security issues (and challenges) that arise in
                  designing and securely deploying controlled manufacturing
                  systems, using industrial robots as a case study---indeed,
                  robots are the most representative instance of a complex
                  automatically controlled industrial device. Following up to
                  our previous experimental analysis, we take a broad look at
                  the deployment of industrial robots in a typical factory
                  network and at the security challenges that arise from the
                  interaction between operators and machines; then, we propose
                  actionable points to secure industrial cyber-physical
                  systems, and we discuss the limitations of the current
                  standards in industrial robotics to account for active
                  attackers.},
