                  for manufacturing, and a critical component of any modern
                  factory. These robots aren't just electromechanical devices
                  but include complex embedded controllers, which are often
                  interconnected with other computers in the factory network,
                  safety systems, and to the Internet for remote monitoring and
                  maintenance. In this scenario, industrial routers also play a
                  key role, because they directly expose the robot's
                  controller. Therefore, the impact of a single, simple
                  vulnerability can grant attackers an easy entry point.

                  Industrial robots must follow three fundamental laws:
                  accurately "read" from the physical world through sensors and
                  "write" (i.e. perform actions) through actuators, refuse to
                  execute self-damaging control logic, and most importantly,
                  echoing Asimov, never harm humans. By combining a set of
                  vulnerabilities we discovered on a real robot, we will
                  demonstrate how remote attackers are able to violate such
                  fundamental laws up to the point where they can alter the
                  manufactured product, physically damage the robot, steal
                  industry secrets, or injure humans.

                  industrial routers and robots: Why these devices are
                  attractive for attackers? What could they achieve? Are they

Industrial robots are complex cyber-physical systems used for manufacturing, and a critical component of any modern factory.

  abstract      = {L’Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) presenta una peculiare convergenza di tecnologie IT e OT, che portano a nuove opportunità per attacchi informatici. Uno dei più interessanti esempi di tale convergenza è il mondo dei robot industriali, che offrono una vasta superficie di attacco come conseguenza delle necessità di flessibilità della produzione e degli obiettivi di riduzione dei relativi costi. Questi macchinari - particolarmente flessibili e potenti - che interagiscono con il mondo fisico rappresentano quindi una ghiotta opportunità per un attaccante che intenda fermare la produzione, sottrarre dati, o addirittura ferire un operatore umano qualora le condizioni siano favorevoli. Questa presentazione l’obiettivo di discutere i principali attacchi contro i sistemi di controllo industriali, con un occhio alla sicurezza delle reti e dei protocolli usati nel campo, concludendo con una discussione delle difese e dei necessari apporti del mondo accademico e industriale per portare avanti la ricerca su questi sistemi in ambito cyber-security.},

As a matter of fact, it is still unclear how AVs work internally. In this paper, we investigate the current state of AVs proposing a methodology to explore AVs capabilities in a black-box fashion. First, we craft samples that trigger specific components in an AV engine, and then we leverage their detection outcome and label as a side channel to infer how such components work. To do this, we developed a framework, crAVe, to automatically test and explore the capabilities of generic AV engines. Finally, we tested and explored commercial AVs and obtained interesting insights on how they leverage their internal components.},
