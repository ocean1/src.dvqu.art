                  for manufacturing, and a critical component of any modern
                  factory. These robots aren't just electromechanical devices
                  but include complex embedded controllers, which are often
                  interconnected with other computers in the factory network,
                  safety systems, and to the Internet for remote monitoring and
                  maintenance. In this scenario, industrial routers also play a
                  key role, because they directly expose the robot's
                  controller. Therefore, the impact of a single, simple
                  vulnerability can grant attackers an easy entry point.

                  Industrial robots must follow three fundamental laws:
                  accurately "read" from the physical world through sensors and
                  "write" (i.e. perform actions) through actuators, refuse to
                  execute self-damaging control logic, and most importantly,
                  echoing Asimov, never harm humans. By combining a set of
                  vulnerabilities we discovered on a real robot, we will
                  demonstrate how remote attackers are able to violate such
                  fundamental laws up to the point where they can alter the
                  manufactured product, physically damage the robot, steal
                  industry secrets, or injure humans.

                  engineering and vulnerability details, and attack PoCs),

                  industrial routers and robots: Why these devices are
                  attractive for attackers? What could they achieve? Are they
                  hard to compromise? How can their security be improved?},

Industrial robots are complex cyber-physical systems used for manufacturing, and a critical component of any modern factory. These robots aren’t just electromechanical devices but include complex embedded controllers, which are often interconnected with other computers in the factory network, safety systems, and to the Internet for remote monitoring and maintenance. In this scenario, industrial routers also play a key role, because they directly expose the robot’s controller. Therefore, the impact of a single, simple vulnerability can grant attackers an easy entry point.

Try to dispel misinformation (“fake news”?) about the robot threat and they will try to articulate reasonable responses for mitigating threats posed by robotic adversaries/allies, including hiding, running away, playing dead and bribery.},
